 Product Metrics 
 What are product metrics ? 
 ●  Product metrics are  quantifiable data points  that  a business tracks and analyzes 
 to evaluate the success of its product. 
 ●  By using interactive product metrics, companies can optimize product strategies 
 to ensure business growth. 
 ●  Determining the  right metrics to monitor and analyze  leads to more intelligent 
 decision-making throughout the product development process. 
 What are KPIs ? 
 ●  These metrics, sometimes called  key performance indicators  (KPIs)  , give the 
 company quantifiable evidence about which aspects of the product / customer 
 experience are resonating with customers, and which aren’t. 
 ●  Product KPIs can be related to user requirements, size, quality, product growth, 
 or user comfort. 
 ●  They can evaluate architectural measures, quality measures, software 
 complexity, or functional size.

**Summary:**
The image focuses on "Product Metrics," possibly indicating a theme or topic related to measuring or analyzing product performance.

Page 2:
 How do companies use these metrics  ? 
 Depending on their goals, companies may use product metrics to : 
 ●  Set their product roadmap 
 ●  Evolve product strategy 
 ●  Make changes to their product 
 ●  Forecast revenue 
 ●  Measure the impact of individual features 
 ●  Better understand user behavior 
 ●  Evaluate the success of a launch 
 ●  Segment their market 
 ●  Test product hypotheses 
 Why are they important from an interview perspective  ? 
 Metric definition questions come up very frequently in Data Science interviews. 
 These questions are generally meant to : 
 1.  test your ability to understand the goal of a product, 
 2.  trace the customer journey with that product and 
 3.  map both the goal and the journey to a set of quantifiable measures. 
 Understanding different product metrics  - 
 There is no fixed categorization of product metrics. 
 Classification can be done on different levels, based on the 
 ●  Goal 
 ●  Task 
 ●  Type 
 of the business and so on. 
 We will look at the three labels of metrics that a company follows in order to grow : 


Page 3:
 Focus metric / North Star metric  - 
 This is the single most important measure of success that matters a lot to a company. 
 A North Star Metric (NSM) should be : 
 ●  A direct reflection of the company’s mission 
 ●  An indicator of how a company brings value to its customers. 
 ●  The only one of its kind. (Avoid having multiple NSMs as this tends to create 
 complexity and confusion) 
 ●  The answer to the following question: What is the one metric that best represents 
 the desired outcome of your company? 
 Which metric, if it were to increase today, would most accelerate my business’ flywheel?

Product Metric Pyramid

01
The most important metric - the North Star. You look at it when you need guidance.

02
2-3 less important metrics linked to actions that impact your North Star.

03
Granular metrics that measure your current actions.
```

### Summary
The Product Metric Pyramid consists of three levels:
1. **North Star Metric**: The most important metric that provides guidance.
2. **Secondary Metrics**: 2-3 less important metrics linked to actions influencing the North Star.
3. **Granular Metrics**: Metrics that measure current actions.

Page 4:
 Level 1 metric / Primary metric  - 
 ●  Primary metrics depict the desired outcome of a particular product, team or 
 initiative. This is unlike the NSM, which represents the desired outcome of the 
 company as a whole. 
 ●  Level 1 (L1) or primary metrics should either directly contribute to the focus 
 metric or act as a check to make sure the product is growing in a healthy 
 direction. 
 ●  The primary metric can be more valuable than the NSM in the short-term 
 because of its narrower focus, tighter feedback loop and more immediate 
 association with the specific product, team or initiative in question. 
 ●  For example, if a product’s focus metric is Weekly active user, a good L1 metric 
 would be 7-day retention to ensure you aren’t spending precious marketing funds 
 to acquire new users who leave after a day or two. 
 Supporting/ Tracking/ Input metric / Level 2 metric  - 
 ●  Performance indicators which are set for the current initiatives that are most 
 granular and mostly used for tracking the progress at lowest level.

 ●  For eg. - There may be some targeted marketing or segmented offers that need 
 to be checked. 
 ●  Supporting metrics are indicators that the primary metric is moving in the right 
 direction. 
 ●  To take the retention example one step further, the Level 2 metric could be iOS 
 app retention. 
 ●  Another could be a Level 2 metric such as the retention of a region or segment of 
 customers.

### Summary

The diagram outlines a metrics structure focused on business performance. The "Focus metric" is emphasized as crucial to the business. It branches into "Level 1 metrics" that include "Reach," "Activation," "Engagement," "Retention," and "Business-specific," which complement the focus metric. "Level 2 metrics" are described as more specific and supportive of the Level 1 and focus metrics, with an example indicating how Level 1 can be divided by various categories like platform or region.

 What’s a product metric interview question  ? 
 ●  Metric interview questions test if candidates can perform data analysis and select 
 key metrics that matter most to the success of a product. 
 ●  Employers like Facebook and Google use these questions to evaluate critical 
 thinking and communication skills. 
 There are two types of metric questions: 
 1.  Metric definition  based : 
 ●  Metric definition questions focus on your ability to define metrics that 
 provide clarity on the health of a product or feature.

 ●  Here’s an example question: “What metrics would you use to determine 
 success for Facebook Sponsored Posts?” 
 ●  There are many different metrics you could be tracking (e.g. impressions, 
 clicks, return on ad spend, etc.) and your interviewer will  want to hear you 
 select the most important ones using a rigorous process. 
 2.  Metric change  based : 
 ●  Metric change questions test if you know what to do when a key product 
 metric (e.g. traffic, revenue, engagement, etc.) is going up or down for no 
 apparent reason. 
 ●  This is almost the same as root cause analysis ie: an approach for 
 identifying the underlying causes of an incident so that the most effective 
 solutions can be identified and solved. 
 We will be focusing on metric definition questions here - 
 Framework for working on such problems  - 
 Here is how you can answer a metrics definition based question : 
 1.  Describe the feature 
 ●  Explain your understanding of the feature, what problem it solves, and 
 how it solves it. 
 ●  Clear if everyone is on the same page related to the problem and features. 
 2.  Determine the goal of the feature 
 ●  In a metrics question you are measuring the success of a feature in 
 achieving a specific goal. 
 ●  Hence, it is crucial to have clarity on what that goal is. 
 3.  Walk through the customer journey 
 ●  Understand the funnel of the product and customer interaction. 
 ●  Walk through the user journey from beginning to the end of the interaction 
 with the feature. 
 ●  This step also helps you think about potential behaviors that can impact 
 the success of the feature. 
 4.  Map and quantify user behaviors 


Page 9:
 ●  Mapping user behaviors that are part of the customer journey and impact 
 the goal of the feature in a positive or negative way. 
 ●  Examples of the customer journey phases a user can go through: 
 Awareness, Acquisition, Activation, Engagement, Retention, Monetization, 
 Referral.   
 ●  Review the phase by highlighting various scenarios / behaviors and 
 relevant outcomes that can have an impact on the goal(s) and explain why 
 measuring the behaviors and (or) their outcomes is relevant. 
 ●  This step helps you determine what needs to be measured. 
 5.  Evaluate your metrics 
 ●  Now that you have gathered a list of metrics that impact the goal, evaluate 
 them based on some meaningful criteria such as reach, impact, 
 confidence, and effort.

 CASE 1: 
 What metric would you look at, to improve retention for a fitness application? 
 ________________________________________________________________ 
 Problem Statement  : 
 There’s a fitness company “PureFit”, who has launched their new application that has 
 various fitness related information like videos and information on how to perform certain 
 exercises, diet management plans, etc. 
 They also have classes and live sessions for users to join and follow. 
 There are two types of customers : 
 1.  Free customers  that have access to certain videos  and information, nothing 
 customizable. 
 2.  Paid customers  that can get personalized diet plans  and advice from experts 
 with respect to their fitness goals.
